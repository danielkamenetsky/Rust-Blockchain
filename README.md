#**Rust Blockchain**
A simple blockchain implementation in Rust.

#**Description**
This project is a basic representation of a blockchain, including functionalities like:

Creating a new blockchain
Mining blocks with a Proof-of-Work mechanism
Adding transactions
Executing smart contracts
Verifying the integrity of the blockchain

#**Usage**
Ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed on your system.
Clone the repository.
Navigate to the project directory and run:
cargo run
This will compile and execute the program.

#**Features**
Transaction System: Allows the addition of transactions between parties.
Proof-of-Work: A simple PoW mechanism requiring the first 4 characters of a block's hash to be "0000".
Smart Contracts: Basic contracts that automatically trigger transactions based on blockchain height.
Integrity Verification: Checks the validity of the entire blockchain.
**Testing**
To run the tests, navigate to the project directory and execute:
cargo test

#**Future Enhancements**
Introduce a consensus mechanism for decentralized validation.
Enhance the smart contract system for more diverse conditions and actions.
Implement cryptographic signatures for transactions to enhance security.
